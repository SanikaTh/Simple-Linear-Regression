'''
A certain food-based company conducted a survey with the help of a fitness 
company to find the relationship between a personâ€™s weight gain and the number
of calories they consumed in order to come up with diet plans for these individuals.
Build a Simple Linear Regression model with calories consumed as the target variable.
Apply necessary transformations and record the RMSE and correlation coefficient values
for different models.'''
